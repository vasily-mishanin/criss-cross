## Overview

"Simple" game of Criss Cross

### The challenge

- [ ] Components must be implemented on classes, no hooks.
- [ ] Implement "help" button which make computer to set symbol in any empty cell (no need to implement logic just use random cell)
- [ ] There should be a button to start a new game. At any time you can reset the game and start again

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup, canvas for strokes on the criss-cross field

- CSS custom properties,

- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - builder

### What I learned

- refresh good old classes on React
- quirky algorithm to play with a robot
- another algorithm of helping turn
- how to use svg X and O
- how to use absolute positioned canvas
- how to draw a lines on the canvas according to props
- you need to ctx.closePath(); for canvas not to remember all line paths

### Continued development

Finished for now
